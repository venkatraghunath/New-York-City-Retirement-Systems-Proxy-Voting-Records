Proxy Voting Data Analytics & Predictive Modeling

Analyzed a ~300,000-row proxy voting dataset from the NYC Retirement Systems, exploring voting trends, company-level patterns, and proposal topics.

Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

Built a Random Forest predictive model to forecast vote instructions (For/Against/Abstain), achieving ~98% accuracy, and identified key factors influencing shareholder voting behavior.
